                <h1><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></span></h1>
<p>
<b>Do I have to have done some dancing before?</b> - No, anyone can learn to Scottish country dancing.
If you have done other forms of dance it can be useful, but not necessary.
</p><p>
<b>Is it expensive?</b> - The door charge for club nights is $5 per night. Club membership (optional) is
$25 per year, payable in March. Paid-up members can buy an 11-trip ticket, for $50 (like a coffee
card: buy ten, get one free).
</p><p>
<b>Do I need a partner?</b> - No, you do not need a regular partner. Scottish country dancing is done in
sets of six or eight people, and you will partner up with a different person for each dance.
</p><p>
<b>What should I wear?</b> - Wear comfortable, casual clothes. It is good to wear layers, as dancing will
soon warm you up and you may want to shed a layer. Many women prefer to wear a skirt, but this
is not compulsory. Shorts are acceptable for men.
</p><p>
<b>Do I need special dancing shoes?</b> - No, to begin with, you can wear soft-soled shoes. The thinner
the sole, the better. Trainers or ballet flats are fine. As you progress, and decide SCD is for you, you
may want to buy some suitable dancing shoes, which are light and make dancing easier.
</p><p>
<b>What if I can't come every week?</b> - In the first few weeks it is helpful if you can come every week,
as the teacher will build up your knowledge from week to week. However, if you cannot come
every week, that is fine.
</p><p>
<b>I'm not Scottish - does that matter?</b> - No, you do not need to be Scottish to enjoy Scottish country
dancing. SCD is done all around the world, not just by people with Scottish links.
</p><p>
<b>What is the difference between Scottish country dancing and Highland dancing?</b> - Scottish
country dancing is social and cooperative, usually danced in sets of six or eight people. It is suitable
for people of all ages and levels of fitness. Highland dancing is competitive solo dancing and very
high energy.
