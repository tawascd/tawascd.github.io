Have you noticed the new heaters? Gone is the somewhat unreliable gas heater, replaced by two heat pumps, and boy, were they pumping out the warm air! A cluster of people were gathering by one of them, relishing the warmth, before dancing started.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We had good attendance, with three sets (plus one). Several regulars have sent apologies - either under the weather, or away on holiday. But we had a new dancer joining us. Welcome to Cameron, who started dancing at Linden Club this year, and is keen to dance twice a week. He did really well, even dancing <i>Links to St Petersburg</i>, which had two formations he had not yet come across. Let's hope he stays!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Being the first Thursday of the month it was a Tartan night, and we had supper - a cuppa and biscuits - and an opportunity for chatting with our fellow members. I'm sorry I forgot to remind people about it (I must admit I forgot about it myself!), and so not a lot of tartan was on show. Better luck next time. Cameron looked good in his brand-new kilt, though!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I had some bad news about <b>Pam Fletcher</b>. On Sunday, I had a call from Pam's husband Ross, to let me know that she had suffered a serious medical event a couple of days earlier, and was being assessed in Auckland. She was to be brought to Wellington Hospital later on Sunday. She will not be able to return to dancing for some weeks. I am sure you will all join me in wishing her well, and hoping for a smooth recovery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">All but two of the night's dances are on the Tawa Annual Dance programme</span></div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Anderson's Rant&nbsp;</b>(R) Tawa - This was the notice board walking warm-up dance.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/140/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/140/</a>&nbsp;It is the first dance on our Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Napier's Index</b>&nbsp;(J ) &nbsp;Tawa -&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Jean Martin of Aberdeen</b>&nbsp;(S) Tawa - We did this last week.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/12542/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/12542/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Lass of Richmond Hill</b>&nbsp;(R) Tawa -&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7795/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7795/</a>&nbsp;This dance has two corner chains.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Links with St Petersburg</b>&nbsp;(J) Tawa - We first practised the "<i>Hello-Goodbye</i>" setting (officially called "<i>set to corners and partne</i>r") and then we practised the "<i>Set and link</i>" that the dance starts with.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13588/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13588/</a>&nbsp;This dance has three stars on our Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Prince Rupert' Fancy</b>&nbsp;(S) &nbsp;Levin - This is on the Levin Club's Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5366/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5366/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Fireworks Reel</b>&nbsp;(R) &nbsp;- This was this week's 'brief only' dance.
