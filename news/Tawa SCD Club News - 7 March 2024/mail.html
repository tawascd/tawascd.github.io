A special welcome back to several of our last years beginners, who had lapsed. Great to see you coming back and giving SCD another go. Welcome back also to Moggie and Carolyn R, who didnt make it to club for most of last year. Catherine was delighted that we had four sets - 32 dancers!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you to those people who completed the membership update form - either by hand or by computer &nbsp;- and to those who have already paid their membership and/or "10-trip" fees. For details about fees, please refer to Hilarys message in last weeks email.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tonights dances</i></b></div><div>Catherine was gentle on us for this first night - to ease our feet and brains back into dancing. We did a number of simple two-couple dances, which, after practising in twos, were danced in 3C sets.</div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Welcome to the Dance</b> (J) - The warm-up dance, to be walked.

The lady needs to move smartly ahead so as not to block her partner. Two bars for each element.</li><li><b>On the Quarter Deck</b> (R) -&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5080/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5080/</a> Finishes with <i>Rights and Lefts</i>.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Paisley Weavers</b> (S) - <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13727/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13727/</a>&nbsp;Starts with two chords, on the 2nd chord, the 2nd couple change sides. This includes a <i>Grand chain</i>, a&nbsp;<i>Ladies Chain</i>, and finishes with two <i>half-R&amp;Ls</i></li><li><b>Deil Amang the Tailors</b> (J) - Catherine gave us a choice of three dances (the other two were <i>Scott Meikle,</i> and <i>Reel of the 51st Divisio</i>n). The popular choice (Scott Meikle) could not be done as it needs four couples, and there were not enough people left for full sets.</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Upcoming events</i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><b style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Friday 29 March to Monday 1&nbsp;</span></b><b>April NZ Branch Teachers Workshop. </b>For anyone interested in teaching - whether already qualified, or just thinking about it.
