We had six sets of dancers on the floor, plus a few who didn't dance. It was lovely to see several who are members but whom we haven't seen for a while. We had 32 of our own members and regulars, plus about another 20 visitors from other clubs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We started out enjoying coffee/tea and lots of lovely dessert goodies, and of course lots of chat and socialising. All the while, Mary McDonald, Sam Berkahn and Anne Goodbehere were quietly setting up to play of us, while Duncan was getting ready to get the balance of the sound right. Then at 7:45, the food was cleared away, and Catherine called us all to get ready to dance. As promised all the dances were really easy (with the exception of one dance for the more experienced).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Many thanks for a great evening to:&nbsp;</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Catherine - for suggesting this event a few years ago. This was the third time we have held a Dessert and Dance Night. The first one was in St John's Hall, before we had the use of our current lovely Bowling Club. They've all been very successful, and this is set to become a yearly event. And thank you for the lovely programme, so well planned and so well taught. I think our visitors were impressed.&nbsp;</li><li>Mary McDonald and her musical friends, Anne Goodbehere on fiddle, and Sam Berkahn on keyboard, and Duncan's assistance on electronics, for their great music. Having live music always lends extra joy and exuberance to an event.</li><li>Jo L and Caroline for organising the cups of tea and coffee, and for clearing up afterwards.</li><li>John and Catherine, and Brenda S, for shifting the bulk of the tables and chairs before everyone arrived. And to all the people who helped put the furniture back at the end of the evening.&nbsp;</li><li>John for his photos.</li><li>Everyone who came along and brought their dessert contributions, what a great spread we had! &nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;">Last&nbsp;night's dances</span></i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Scotch Mixer</b> (R) - This was our walking warmup dance. Groups of two couples facing each other, all in a random spread around the room. The final eight bars of each repeat, all couples promenade around to find another couple to dance with.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14809/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14809/</a>. A great way to meet others and it caused quite a bit of laughter as people rushed about trying to get together with another pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><b>Happy to Meet</b> (J) - Devised by Wellington teacher Iain Boyd. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/2782/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/2782/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Auld Grey Cat</b> (R) - Also devised by Iain Boyd.

The title has nothing to do with garden implements. Historically a <i>rake</i> was "<span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd" lang="en">a man who was habituated to immoral conduct, particularly womanising".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5462/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5462/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>St Andrew's Fai</b>r (J) - <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5802/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5802/</a>&nbsp; We did this dance last week.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Pluto's Head</b> (R) - <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9486/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9486/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>12 Coates Crescent</b> (S) - <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9106/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9106/</a>&nbsp; The name of the dance is the address of the RSCDS HQ in Edinburgh</li><li><b>The Cranberry Tart</b> (J) - As Catherine said "<i>We can't have a pudding night without a tart</i>". This dance was for the more experienced. In my set there were several people who hadn't done it before, but they managed quite well. In the first 16 bars, the lady does the same as the man, but two bars later. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9157/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9157/</a></li><li><b>The Deil Amang the Tailors</b> (R) - A great favourite all around the SCD world, especially as a last dance in a programme, as it is fast and joyous and finishes with a circle. In the last repeat the circle often takes in all the sets down a line, all holding hands in one big circle (or oblong ...)</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div>As usual, John was there with his camera to record the event.
