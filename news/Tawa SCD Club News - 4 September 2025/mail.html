We're pleased our three hardy beginners are still coming along, and doing really well. If any of the other beginners are able and interested in coming back, we would love to see them!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>In the new dancers' section ...</i></b></div><div>We learned just one new formation:</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 17px;">Reels of Three</b></div><div>In 3-couple sets:&nbsp;</div><div>To start with, Catherine got each couple, in turn, to walk a<b><i> figure of 8</i></b> along the sides. Partners can touch nearer hands when they come into the middle&nbsp;</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>The 1s walk a fig 8, by starting in and down.</li><li>The 2s walk a fig 8, by going out and up</li><li>The 3s walk a fig 8, by going in and up.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Then, all three couples walked their <b>figure of 8</b> path <b>at the same time</b>. This is called a <b>Reel of Three</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>The 1s go in and down, 2s go out and up, 3s go in and up (You will hear this description often when dances are "briefed").&nbsp;</li><li>In effect all three couples are covering the same path, rather like three slot cars running on the same track.&nbsp;</li><li>To avoid collisions, the 3s (going in and up) must give way to the 1s (going in and down).&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/OuWzbkrnyvE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/OuWzbkrnyvE</a></li><li>This formation is also referred to as "<i>mirror reels</i>" or "<i>reflection reels</i>".</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Once we had mastered this, we danced "<i>The Auld Grey Cat</i>", which includes <i>reels of three.</i>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div style="">We started with a warm-up walking dance, "<i>Crabbit Shona"</i>, then did the stretches and ankle exercises in a large circle. This time, we practised moving sideways, as in stepping up (or down), <b>step, cross, step, close </b>(<a href="https://youtu.be/axF4GUffvGs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/axF4GUffvGs</a>)&nbsp;<b>-</b>&nbsp;twice in one direction, then on the toes; twice in the other direction, then bend the knees. Repeat.</div><div style="">&nbsp;</div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Crabbit Shona</b> (J) - This was our walking warm-up dance. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13259/./" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13259/./</a>&nbsp;We danced this last week.</li><li><b>The Auld Grey Cat</b> (R) - This dance includes <i>reels of three</i>. Devised by Wellington teacher Iain Boyd.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/295/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/295/</a>. Beware - there are two dances with the same name, which are quite different (the other one is quite complex). &nbsp;</li><li><b>12 Coates Crescent</b> (S) - This is a 4C dance in a 4C set. So each couple dances it only once, or as they say, "<i>once to the bottom</i>". <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9106/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9106/</a>&nbsp;The name of the title is the address of the HQ of the RSCDS (Royal Scottish Country Dance Society) in Edinburgh.&nbsp;</li><li><b>St Andrew's Fair </b>(J) - This dance includes some "<i>setting</i>" which the new dancers have not yet encountered, but Catherine said "Just jiggle in place". <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5802/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5802/</a></li><li><b>Memories of Mary Ann</b> (S) - a 3C strathspey in a 3C dance. Includes <i>Set &amp; link for 3</i>, finishes with a <i>Knot</i>. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14976/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14976/</a></li><li><b>The Ullapool Ferry</b> (R) - We did this one last week. It includes a<i> Hello-Goodbye Poussette</i>. It is a fun dance, and we did it twice, so that Catherine could dance it too. She sent me a photo of her on the Ullapool Ferry taken when she was in Scotland only a few months ago.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Merlin's Thorn</b> (J) - We have done this dance before, some weeks ago. This dance finishes with a <i>Helix</i>.</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div>Numbers 2, 3 and 4 are on next week's Dessert Night programme - all are easy and straightforward. The new dancers stayed to watch No. 5, and then we had supper. The last two dances are on the programme for the Lower Hutt Annual Dance on Saturday.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div></div></div></body></html><html><body style="overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><head><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"></head><div dir="auto" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div></div><div>Here's Catherine on the Ullapool Ferry - "<i>21st June, the longest day.

Ngaio, who also dance on a Thursday, will be closing their club for the night, so that their members can come to us. <b>Note the early start. </b>We will start at <b>7:00 pm</b>, with socialising, enjoying dessert and a cuppa, and dancing will start from 7:45. Catherine has planned a programme of easy dances, with our new dancers in mind. We hope that new dancers from the other clubs will attend too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Please bring a small plate of dessert-type finger-food to share - nothing that needs heating up, or that needs spoons and bowls.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since we are expecting guests from other clubs we will have to move all the tables out of the way. It will be great if some of the more able-bodied members could come early, e.g. 6:30 or 6:40 to help shift the tables and chairs. Unfortunately some of us (including me) are no longer able to do much lifting. I will have the doors open by 6:00 pm, as the band needs time to set up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Upcoming events</i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline" style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><li><b>THIS Saturday 6 September,</b> 7:30 pm -<b> Lower Hutt Club Annul Dance</b>, Knox Church Hall, 547 High Street, Lower Hutt.

These new dancers will have received a personal invitation to come along, and enter at a reduced price. But longer-standing dancers from all around the region will be attending to support the new dancers. The programme will be easy dances, that any first- and second-year dancers can manage. Two "preparation classes" are held in the weeks before the main event, in which all the dances on the programme are danced, so that everyone can feel comfortable dancing them at the NDC. It is the biggest event in the Wellington Region with usually 10 to 12 sets, and of course, live music. <b>(Note</b>: it is probably too early in their dancing journey for our current beginners to attend this dance. But please keep on dancing, and you'll be able to attend next year!)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Afternoon dancing</i></b> (Tuesdays 12:45-2:45 pm)</div><div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">9 Sep - Experienced group with Elizabeth Ferguson</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">16 Sep - General group with Catherine</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">23 Sep - Experienced group with Iain Boyd (the first of six sessions he will be teaching)</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">30 Sep - Bonus general group with Catherine (5 Tuesdays in September!)</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Finally ...</i></b></div><div>Remember to bring your dessert contribution next week, and please consider coming early to help shift the tables out of the way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I hope to see some of you tomorrow night at the Lower Hutt Annual Dance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That's all for this week.
