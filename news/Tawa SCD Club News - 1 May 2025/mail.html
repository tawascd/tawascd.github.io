The 'red' warning and official advice to avoid going out in the wild weather tonight made us decide that it would be the safe and sensible thing to do. Hopefully none of you have suffered any damage in the storm, and were able to keep dry and warm. You might even have enjoyed your "evening off".&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for getting back to me so promptly to let me know you had received my cancellation email.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I bet you didn't expect to get a newsletter tonight in view of the cancellation, but since I had this just about ready to go - just had to add in "tonight's dances" - I will send it off anyway &nbsp;as there is quite bit in the way of information in it. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tonight's dances</i></b></div><div>Well, that didn't happen, did it &nbsp;...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Upcoming events</i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><b>This Saturday 3 May</b>, 7:00 pm -&nbsp;<b style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Manawatu Scottish Society SCD Club 70th Anniversary Dance</b><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">, Whakarongo Hall, cnr Stoney Creek Rd and Napier Hwy, Palmerston North.

On the future of NZ Summer Schools:</b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><div style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Avenir-Book;">At the Branch AGM, a document was produced (attached) about the future of NZ Summer Schools. One suggestion is that Summer School would alternate between Christchurch and Wellington as this would organisationally probably be more efficient. However, it could be more onerous for clubs in terms of providing&nbsp;helpers and baking. The region is seeking&nbsp;feedback from clubs as to how members feel about&nbsp;such a suggestion. This feedback will then be collated and passed back to the Branch.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Avenir-Book;">The link to the&nbsp;Branch information is below but I have also downloaded and attached&nbsp;the relevant&nbsp;document. The missing figures for Wellington are 151 registrations of which 81 were resident.</div><div style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Avenir-Book;"><a href="https://dancescottish.org.nz/branch-agm-reports/" target="_blank" target="_blank">https://dancescottish.org.nz/branch-agm-reports/</a></div></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><br></div><div>If you have any feedback on either issue, please send them to me (Desiree), and I will pass on your comments.</div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Waikato-Bay of Plenty Region Newsletter</i></b></div><div>This interesting WaiBOP newsletter is attached.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>King's Birthday Weekend School</i></b> - <b>Cambridge, Saturday 31 May - Sunday 1 June</b></div><div>Details and registration&nbsp;<a href="https://wellingtonscd.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Flyer-Advanced-2025-Final.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp;An information sheet was attached last week.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>RSCDS Newsletter</i></b></div><div>The April newsletter can be accessed<a href="https://mailchi.mp/rscds/dance_scottish_together_april2025?e=967a522f1b" target="_blank"> here.</a>&nbsp; This month's "Blether" (chat) focuses on a project to archive all of Jon Drewry's dances - all 850 of them! - by TAC - the Teachers' Association of Canada.
