It was wet and cold last night, so it wasn't surprising we had a pretty low turn-out. We had just 12 people there. Thank you to the staunch people who did come along tonight! And thank you to Elizabeth and Malcolm for braving the weather.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since today was the first Thursday of the month, we had supper. I had forgotten that tonight would be our "Tartan Night" with supper, but fortunately Jo was on the ball, and brought along all the supper paraphernalia. Thank you Jo! It was nice to have time for a chat over a cuppa.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Warm-ups</b> - Tonight's walking warm-up in a circle fell apart when some couples launched into a grand chain, while others did the sideways step. Result: a complete mix-up of couples, and we spent a few minutes sorting out which of the women were supposed to be "men"! Lots of hilarity!&nbsp;</li><li><b>Centenary Jig</b> (J) -&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/21320/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/21320/</a>&nbsp;This is on the programme of the Upper Hutt Annual Dance.

They will run for the first hour of our club nights, on 31 July, 7, 14, and 21 August, from 7:30 to 8:30, after which our 'normal' club teaching will resume. Because current members will effectively have just half the usual teaching time, and will be supporting the new recruits while they learn the basics, paid-up Tawa members will not pay the usual door charge for these four weeks (this goes for people who have "10-trips" as well, of course).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Catherine believes that there will be people looking for a new indoors activity to learn during the winter, and we hope that this will bring us a bunch of keen new dancers. We will be starting our "advertising campaign" next week, and we need everyone's help in spreading the word.&nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div><div>What we are doing:</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>I have created a poster, which is attached below</li><li>I have sent a brief article and photo about us and the classes to the Tawa Residents Association newsletter that will be published in the last week of July.</li><li>Helen M will place our poster on Facebook community pages of areas around Tawa (ranging from Johnsonville to Whitby and Mana).

If you have access to a colour printer, please print the poster and distribute. For those who can't print colour, I will get some posters printed. <b>Please let me know ASAP </b>if you can help with this, and how many you think you can place.&nbsp;</li><li>Offer small flyers to friends. I will get a bunch of quarter-size posters printed, and will have them at club next week.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Many thanks for your help.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>That's all for this week. Have a lovely weekend, and I hope to see lots of you at club next week. Even if it's wet and cold outside, it will be warm at the Bowling Club, and dancing will soon warm you up!</div><div><br></div><div>Desiree</div><div><div><div dir="auto" style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Desiree Patterson</div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">tawa@dancesescottish.org.nz</div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Secretary, Tawa SCD Club</div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"></div></div></div></div></div></div><li><a href="4-up Advert 2025.pdf" target="_blank"><big>4-up Advert 2025</big></a><br><li><a href="Advert_Intro classes_2025.pdf" target="_blank"><big>Advert_Intro classes_2025</big></a><br><li><a href="Day School Notice 2025.pdf" target="_blank"><big>Day School Notice 2025</big></a><br>
