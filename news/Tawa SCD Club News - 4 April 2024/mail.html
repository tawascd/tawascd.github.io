We welcome Caroline Sherborne as the new committee member. Thank you for taking the plunge, Caroline! She got stuck in right away and helped Jo with organising supper. Excellent!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There was some discussion around the wording used in my weekly newsletters, which apparently have made some folk feel that there was too much pressure to attend club. If that is so, I apologise. I would never wish to <i>pressure</i> anyone, but I do like to <i>encourage</i> people and make them feel welcome. I believe Tawa is a friendly club, and I would hope that people come along because they enjoy the dancing, the excellent teaching, and the company of other dancers.</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Tonight’s dances&nbsp;</i></b></div><div>Because we had the AGM, we only had time to do six dances. Catherine’s focus for tonight was on “corners” and on a bit of step practise - of doing skip change backwards. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Pluto’s Head</b> (R) – This was our warm-up ‘walking’ dance. It’s a 2C dance, and we danced (walked) it in 3C sets,&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9486/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9486/</a></li><li><b>Crom Allt</b> (R) – The name is Gaelic for “Crooked Burn” or "Crooked Stream”. In this dance, devised by Roy Goldring, the dancing couple and their corners <i>advance and retire</i>, then turn (RH with 1st corner, LH with 2nd corner).&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1426/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1426/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Mad Hatter</b> (J) – Before dancing this, Catherine had us practise “<i>reverse skip change</i>”. She explained that when dancing ‘<i>advance and retire</i>’, you have to dance skip change backwards. Just as an ordinary skip change starts with a’ hop', so too does the reverse skip change start with a ‘hop'. (If there is no ‘hop', it will look more like a Pas de Basque). In this dance, devised by Wellingtonian Iain Boyd, the first couple and their corners <i>advance and retire</i>, and then dance <i>back-to-back</i>.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4058/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4058/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>A Trip to Bavaria</b> (R) – This dance is on the programme of the Ngaio Annual Dance on 11 May. Catherine spent quite a while putting everyone through their paces for this 4C dance. The gist of it (for the first 16 bars) is: the end couples cross RH, while the two couples in the middle dance R hands across half way. All change places LH along the sides. And repeat.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6712/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6712/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>City of Belfast</b> (S) – A great favourite. Again corners feature, when the 1s set to their corners. This dance finishes with an Espagnole.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13847/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13847/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Napier’s Index</b> (J) – This dance was devised for Keith Napier, who for many years maintained a computerised index of Scottish country dances. This dance too, featured corners. In this case, the 1s <i>balance in line</i> with their corners.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/</a>&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Easter Weekend Teachers’ Workshop</i></b></div><div>I gather the workshop was a resounding success. They had over 65 participants for the Workshop - teachers and aspiring teachers, from all around NZ, as well as a few from Australia. Catherine and Maureen Sullivan were both on the organising committee, so congratulations to them both for a brilliant weekend. Those of you who follow the NZ Branch on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dancescottishnewzealand">https://www.facebook.com/dancescottishnewzealand</a>&nbsp;) will have seen some of the photos and videos that the Branch Communications Coordinator, Su Marshall, has posted. The two evening dances that were open to everyone, had amazing numbers - about 12 or 13 sets on the floor. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the Friday one, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Saturday dance. Hilary and Mary were both in the bands that provided music for the event - Hilary, along with Aileen and Jason, played for the special class on Friday night; and Mary and Lynne played for the teachers’ session on Saturday, and played again, along with Thomas and Richard, for the evening dance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div></body></html>
