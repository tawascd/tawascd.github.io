We finished with just two sets. I had apologies from several people who couldn't make it tonight.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Tonight's dances</i></b>&nbsp;</div><div>Tonight's teaching theme was the "<a href="https://youtu.be/GZTmIls0e8I" target="_blank">Ladies' Chain</a>", as it occurred in several of the dances. There was also one "<i>Men's Chain</i>", a formation that does not get danced nearly as often as the Ladies' variety.&nbsp;</div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Scotch Mixer</b> (R) - This was our walking warm-up. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14809/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14809/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Napier's Index</b> (J) - This dance was dedicated to Keith Napier, who was an early creator of an index of SC dances. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Paisley Weavers</b> (S) - Before we danced this 3C strathspey, we practised the <i>Ladies' Chain</i>. This dance starts with two chords - the first chord is for the bow/curtsey to one's partner, on the second chord, the couple in 2nd place cross to the opposite side. The dance is cleverly devised so that after each time through, the new 2nd couple finishes on their opposite side. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13727/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13727/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Mrs Stewart's Jig</b> (J) - The dance is dedicated to Mrs Ysobel Stewart of Fasnacloich, one of the founders of the RSCDS (or SCDS, at the time). In this dance a <i>Grand Chain </i>is&nbsp;followed immediately by, and flows into, a<i> Ladies' Chain</i>.<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4805/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4805/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Sailor</b>&nbsp;(R) - A perennial favourite.

In the <i>Men's Chain</i>, the men change places <b>Left</b> hand in the S-shaped diagonal, while the ladies dance the little oval on the sides. &nbsp; <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/695/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/695/</a>&nbsp;This is also on our Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b><i><font size="5">AGM - Next week, 3 April&nbsp;</font></i></b></div><div>The AGM will take place at around 8:00 or 8:30 pm, during our club night. &nbsp;We hope that as many of you as possible will be able to attend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We will be calling for nominations for the committee. We would like at least two new committee members. Being on the club committee is not an onerous task. We have few committee meetings, and the main busy time for the committee is organising the club's Annual Dance (on 24 May). Please consider giving the club some of your time.&nbsp;</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Brenda will be standing down after three years as President. We thank her for her service. Jo Lockhart has agreed to take on the role of President. &nbsp;</li><li>Hilary has agreed to continue as Treasurer, and Colin and Caroline will also continue on the committee.</li><li>I will continue as Secretary for this year, but I will be standing down in 2026, having done the job for 13 years by then. So we will be looking for someone to take on the Secretary role in 2026. Ideally, it will be someone who will be on the committee this year, as a sort of "Vice secretary" for this year, then Secretary next year. The job is not as daunting as it might seem, as you can see in the<b> attached Job Description</b>. The person who takes it on will be able to shape it to their own preference.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Attached are:</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Minutes of the 2024 AGM</li><li>Agenda for the 2025 AGM</li><li>Brenda's President's Report for 2024</li><li>Hilary's Treasurer's Report for 2024</li><li>Nomination from</li><li>Secretary job description</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Please read the reports before coming to club next Thursday - it will save time (i.e. no need to read them out on the night), so we can get on with the dancing, and save paper (no need to print a pile of reports).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Other upcoming events</i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline" style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><li><b>Saturday 12 April,&nbsp;</b>1:00 - 4:30 pm&nbsp;<b>- Early Dances Day.&nbsp;</b>This special event will focus on dances from books 6-10, which aren't often danced these days. Suitable for intermediate dancers. The tutor will be Elaine Laidlaw, and there will be live music and&nbsp;afternoon tea. At St John's Church Hall, Bassett Road, Johnsonville. A poster was attached last week.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Monday 14 April,</b>&nbsp;7:30 pm -&nbsp;<b>Johnsonville SCD Club</b>&nbsp;are having their first&nbsp;<b>Tartan Night</b>&nbsp;for the year. Khandallah Town Hall, Ganges Road, Khandallah. There will be live music from Jason Morris, Hilary Ferral and Anna Miller. Programme attached below. A Tartan night is like a club night, but with live music and with guests from other clubs. Attendees are encouraged to wear some tartan (but it's not compulsory). It should be a great evening's dancing. It is designed to give new dancers the opportunity to dance to live music. Dancers in their first year are welcome to join and try a night at a different club. Programme was attached last week.</li><li><b>Saturday 3 May,&nbsp;</b>7:00 pm -&nbsp;<b>Manawatu Scottish Society SCD Club 70th Anniversary Dance</b>, Whakarongo Hall, car Stoney Creek Rd and Napier Hwy, Palmerston North. Music provided by Saltire SCD Band (Mary McDonald &amp; friends). Debbie Roxburgh will be the MC, and the dance will start with a Grand March, piped in by Nicole Trewavas. The programme and cribsheet were attached on 6 March. I will attach &nbsp;them again closer to the time.</li><li><b>Saturday 24 May,</b> 7:30 pm -<b><font size="4" color="#e32400"> Tawa Club Annual Dance</font></b>. Keep this night free on your calendar! Our special night is a bit earlier than usual this year, as Catherine &nbsp;will be away in June-July. Because it is so early in the year, the programme consists of easy, mostly well-known dances in the first half, and somewhat more advanced dances in the second half. We will have music from Hilary, Jason and Johnny Bourne. The programme is attached below. Other clubs have been invited.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Region Classes</i></b></div><div>Registrations for Basics and Intermediate classes are now open, further information is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wellingtonscd.org.nz/classes/region-classes/" target="_blank">Wellington Region website</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Region classes at different levels provide an opportunity for dancers to work on their dancing skills alongside others at the same level.
