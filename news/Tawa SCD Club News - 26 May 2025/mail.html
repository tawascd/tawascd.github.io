We had a great programme, a great band, and eight sets of dancers on the floor, plus a bunch of spectators.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A record 32 Tawa members came along to enjoy the music and the dancing, plus Catherine and Hilary who were up on stage. I was delighted to see Maureen Robson and Jan Bruce, two of our life members. Maureen is back to dancing (just strathspeys) since her hip surgery, and Jan came along to enjoy the music and watch the dancing. She said to me "<i>I was dancing along with you all inside my head</i>".</div><div><br></div><div>A further 36 dancers came from clubs all around the region, and some from further afield - Palmerston North and Mosgiel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What did you think of Catherine's brilliant idea of getting re-usable background sheets printed with "our" tartan to post our programme on? A stroke of genius! The same tartan as the stage drapes, the table runners, and the name tag hanger - all of which she made too. And in the future, any programmes we will be sending out will have the same tartan background too! &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It was great that so many of our members pitched in to help make the event so successful. Special thanks go to:</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Catherine for her great programme, which was obviously much enjoyed by all</li><li>The band of Hilary, Jason and Jonny - who made a wonderful sound, and kept us all energised</li><li>Colin and Denis, for providing the greenery and fairy lights to decorate the front of the stage</li><li>Jo, Helen M, Laura and their band of helpers for organising supper, pouring coffee and tea, doing the dishes, and clearing up afterwards</li><li>Jo for preparing the fruit salad, and Fiona McC for bringing the jellies</li><li>Everyone who brought in their supper contributions</li><li>Denis who took the table cloths home for laundering</li><li>John and Joy for recording the event with their cameras (see below)&nbsp;</li><li>The committee and extra helpers, who came along to set up the hall in the afternoon, and finally,</li><li>Everyone who pitched in to pack up and tidy the hall. We managed to get it all done in next to no time. I was able to return the key (into the library book return slot) just before the witching hour of 11 pm!&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div><img src="IMGP9750.jpeg" alt="IMGP9750.jpeg"></div><div>Catherine briefing the first dance -<i> The Old Man of Storr</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><img src="IMGP9751.jpeg" alt="IMGP9751.jpeg"></div><div>The Allemande in <i>Joie de Vivre</i></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><img src="IMGP9773.jpeg" alt="IMGP9773.jpeg"></div><div><i>Links with St Petersburg</i></div><div><br></div><div><img src="_6M29275 (Large).jpeg" alt="_6M29275 (Large).jpeg"><br><div>

We did, however, have one interruption to proceedings. After five dances, people were asked to take a seat, as Rod Downey, as President of the Wellington Region, had an announcement to make.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I must admit I am embarrassed to have to say this, as I don't like blowing my own trumpet, but what Rod was announcing, was for me to come forward to be presented with a <b>Region Award</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I was absolutely shellshocked. It was such a surprise. Apparently a number of people were in on the secret, but I never suspected anything. John, Joy and Loralee were at the ready to take photos of the presentation. For further details, you'll have to go to the&nbsp;<a href="https://wellingtonscd.org.nz/home/awards/wellington-region-awards/#desireepatterson" target="_blank">Region website.</a>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I want to thank the Region for giving me this award - I have enjoyed, and am still enjoying, the activities that are mentioned in the citation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="IMGP9756.jpeg" alt="IMGP9756.jpeg"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>See you all on Thursday, for Catherine's final class before she heads off on a well-deserved holiday. Elizabeth Ferguson will teach us during her absence.</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers</div><div>Desiree</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div dir="auto" style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div><br></div><div>Desiree Patterson</div><div>tawa@dancesescottish.org.nz</div><div>Secretary, Tawa SCD Club</div></div></div></div>
