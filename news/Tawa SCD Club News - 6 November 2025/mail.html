We danced just six dances, though Catherine had a couple more dances up her sleeve, but we spent time on learning (or refining) a few formations that our new dancers hadn't yet done, so we ran out of time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There was a bit of excitement just after 9 pm, when Wellington was shaken by a 4.9 earthquake - felt as a short sharp jolt in Tawa - and several people dived to get under tables. Some said they had heard or felt it coming. After that Catherine had us move some of the chairs out of the way, so the tables would be clear for diving under if there was more to come, but luckily there was no more shaking.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Next week</i></b></div><div>There will be <b style="font-size: 18px;"><i><font color="#ff2600">no dancing at Tawa next week</font></i></b> (13 November), so that our members can attend <b>Ngaio Club's Final Night, at 7:30 pm,&nbsp;</b>at the Khandallah Presbyterian Church Hall, Ganges Road, Khandallah (opposite the supermarket). There will be live music from Jason and Hilary, and there will be supper at the end. A programme is attached below.</div><div>In return, the Ngaio members will join us the following week (20 November) for our Final Night of the 2025 dancing year.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">All of last night's dances are on the programmes of either Ngaio's or our own final night, or both.&nbsp;</span></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>New Year Jig</b> (J) - This was tonight's walking warm-up dance. As Catherine mentioned this is a 'Tawa fixture' as it was devised by our former tutor Maureen Robson. The music for this dance was composed specially for Maureen by the late Peter Elmes, and is called "Maureen Robson's Jig". <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17898/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17898/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Shifting' Bobbins</b> (R) - A firm favourite all around the SCD world. Note that the 1s dance most of it on their opposite sides. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6048/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6048/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Paisley Weavers</b> (S) - This dance includes a <i>ladies' chain</i> and a <i>grand chain</i>, which were new for our new dancers, so Catherine spent a bit of time teaching these (see the details a bit further down). The dance starts with two chords, the first is for the usual bow/curtsey, the second is for the 2nd couple to cross to their opposite sides. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13727/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13727/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Kissing Bridge</b> (R) - The 'tricky' manoeuvre in this dance is the dancing couple changing sides. They lead down the middle and change sides by the lady going under the man's arm, before leading back up. We all practised this a few times first.This move sometimes causes even seasoned dancers a bit of bother. There are often funny wriggles and laughter ... The dance finishes with a <i>poussette</i>, which we learned last week, but we had another practice of it. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14977/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14977/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Granville Market</b> (J) - <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13621/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13621/</a>&nbsp;This includes the 1s turning their corners, and passing each other R shoulder (see details below).&nbsp;</li><li><b>Anna Holden's Strathspey</b> (S) -&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/159/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/159/</a> This lovely strathspey includes<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/naQFYapIifU" target="_blank">petronella in tandem</a></i>, which some of us had to learn. This&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/PL41nXhVA8w" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;was made at our Tuesday afternoon dancing session, for the&nbsp;<a href="https://rscds.org/blog/new-zealand-pick-52-project" target="_blank">Pick up 52 Project</a>&nbsp;in 2023. You'll recognise some of the dancers. Dancing as first lady, in the first set on the left, is former Tawa member Karen Harris, who sadly died suddenly a few months after this video was made.&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div style=""><b>Ladies' Chain</b></div><div>This is a 2C formation, starting with the 2nd couple on their opposite sides, and both men facing <b>out</b></div><div>The ladies change places R hand (on the diagonal), curving round to end up in the spot opposite where they started from. (Catherine used the analogy of 'using the 3rd exit on a roundabout')</div><div>The men dance up/down the sides in a slight curve, to change places L hand with the lady as she comes out of the diagonal curve.</div><div>Repeat.&nbsp;</div><div>There is no progression - everyone finishes in the same place as where they began.&nbsp;</div><div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><br></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b>Grand Chain</b></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">This is like an "expanded Rights and lefts" as it is done with six people.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">The 1s face each other across the set; the 2s face down, the 3s face up (i.e. the 2s and 3s face each other)</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">All change places R hand with the person they face, then L hand with the next person, continuing in the same direction RH, LH, RH and LH, till they get back to their original place. &nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Timing is critical: the formation takes 8 bars, but there are only 6 'hands'. So the timing is RH 1 bar, LH 1 bar, RH&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;bars; LH 1 bar, RH 1 bar, LH&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;bars;</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Also expressed as:<b>&nbsp;Right, Left, Ri-i-ight; Left, Right, Le-e-eft.</b>&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">The chain finishes with a courtesy turn for the last left hand for 1M and 2L ( hold the last left a little longer, keep looking at the person who's hand you're holding and turn into place). &nbsp;.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/XhkqlBZ_j7w" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/XhkqlBZ_j7w</a>&nbsp;</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"></div><div><b>Turning corners in <i>Granville Market</i></b></div><div><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">With the 1st couple in the middle, facing their 1st corners, turn their 1st corner RH, then passing partner by the Right Shoulder; face 2nd corner, turn 2nd corner, and passing partner by the Right shoulder, dance to own side. The corners make the turns in just two bars, while the dancing couple make the turn wider, so that they can pass their partner by the Right shoulder.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Upcoming events</i></b></div><div>You could dance almost every night next week if you're keen!&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><b>Thursday 13 Novembe</b>r, 7:30 pm - <b>Ngaio Club Final Night</b>.

Diane Bradshaw&nbsp;taught 9 or 10 dances from the latest RSCDS Book 54. Some were easy and straightforward, a few were more complex. Diane spent some time teaching three formations that not everyone would have come across: the <i>Rondell</i> (in <i>Tullynesle and Forbes Hall</i>); &nbsp;the <i>Targe</i> (in <i>The Waternish Tangle</i>), and <i>Shiehallion Reels</i>, in a triangular set (<i>A Driving Reel</i>). It was a long&nbsp;afternoon, four hours (1-5pm), so the lovely afternoon tea provided by Elaine and Kevin Lethbridge was most welcome. By the end of the afternoon, I think everyone was pretty much tired out, b</font><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">ut it had been a most enjoyable time for all. And what a&nbsp;</span><font face="Avenir-Book">tour de force from Diane! Four hours of teaching, and ten <b>new</b> dances that she had to commit to memory so as to be able to teach them - no mean feat!
