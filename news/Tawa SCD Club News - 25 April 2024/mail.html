With a nod to Anzac Day, Catherines had a selection of dances which sort of fit the theme. She managed to find dances for all the armed forces - Navy <i>(The Sailor</i>), Army (<i>Reel of the 51st </i>and<i> The Soldiers Dance</i>) and Air Force (<i>The Aviator</i>), plus some ... Despite it being a public holiday, we had reasonably good numbers - just short of three sets, with Catherine and a ghost dancer having to complete one of the sets. It was lovely to see Pat Reesby, who used to be a member but now regularly dances at Capital City.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Last nights dance</i></b><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>s</i></b></div><div>One of the dances was quite complex and caused a great deal of confusion and hilarity with people heading in all sorts of wrong directions.</div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Maxwells Rant </b>(R) This was the warm-up, walking dance that Catherine put up on the notice board for people to read and digest. We danced it last week too. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4239" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4239</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Shiftin Bobbins</b> (R) Annes favourite dance, and probably a favourite of many other dancers. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6048/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6048/</a>&nbsp;It has been ranked amongst the twenty most popular dances.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Dundee Whaler</b> (S) This dance features petronellas and a ladies' chain. The last eight bars, to get the dancers back to their own sides, represent the tacking of a ship, so there are no polite turns, as they need to be sharp turns. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1838/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1838/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Sailor</b> (R) This is also a very popular dance. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5794/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5794/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Soldiers Dance</b> (J) This dance was quite complex, and the sets became seriously unstuck at various times. It was quick, and dancers ended up in unusual positions, and then there was a<i> Ladies Chain</i>, which was danced turned through 90 degrees, i.e. the men do their little loop across the dance, instead of along the sideline. This confused everyone, but we all laughed and nobody got upset for getting it wrong. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6181/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6181/</a>&nbsp;Unfortunately there is only a description in this link, but no video. Catherine commented later that perhaps she should have chosen&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6182/" target="_blank">The Soldiers Joy</a>, which is a much simpler dance.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Sleeping Warrior</b> (S) The name of this dance refers to the profile of the north Arran hills in Scotland as seen from the Ayrshire coast. It looks like a resting human figure. This dance starts with two chords, to allow the 2s and 4s to cross to the other side. It includes <i>interlocking Allemandes</i>. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6150/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6150/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Reel of the 51st Division</b> (R) Ever popular, the is THE soldiers dance. Devised by Scottish soldiers &nbsp;in a POW camp during WW2, for a set of all men (obviously), this is often danced as an all-men set at dance events. The dance includes "<i>diagonal balance in line</i> which symbolises the Scottish Saltire. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5525/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5525/</a>&nbsp;Do read the Extra Info in this link.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Aviator</b> (J) A dance that is becoming increasingly popular. Wonderful opportunity for covering in the reels. Read the Extra info on the link, which describes a glider (plane) and a buzzard (bird) which mirrored the gliders flight, which is what the deviser wants to emulate. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14401/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14401/</a>&nbsp; (To my shame, I piked on this dance, not only because I was really tired, but also because I always manage to get it wrong. I must try to overcome this &nbsp;- maybe, one day ...)&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>An interesting connection</i></b></div><div>I discovered an interesting connection between <b><i>Shiftin Bobbins</i></b> and the next dance, <b><i>"The Dundee Whaler"</i></b>. The shiftin bobbins" of the title refer to the textile industry in Lancashire during the Industrial Revolution. Scroll to the bottom of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scottish-country-dancing-dictionary.com/dance-crib/shiftin-bobbins.html" target="_blank">this link</a>&nbsp;for details. Shiftin the bobbins, i.e. replacing the empty ones with full ones, was a job most often done by children. While the dance probably refers to the cotton mills in Lancashire, the title of the dance was found in&nbsp;<i>"The Jute Mill Song</i> which refers to the jute spinning industry in Dundee. Here is a&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/5brQCPxxlSM" target="_blank">video of that song</a>, which clearly mentions <i>shiftin bobbins</i>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The connection to <i>"The Dundee Whaler</i> is that in Dundee, the jute spinning industry developed when it was discovered that jute becomes stronger when it is lubricated with whale oil. In the 19th century, Dundee, a whaling port, was the centre of the global jute industry.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A Wikipedia entry about Dundee states <font face="Avenir-Book"><i>"The phasing out of the linen export bounty between 1825 and 1832 stimulated demand for cheaper textiles, particularly for cheaper, tough fabrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery that the dry fibres of jute could be lubricated with whale oil&nbsp;(of which Dundee had a surfeit) to allow it to be processed in mechanised mills resulted in the Dundee mills rapidly converting from linen to jute, which sold at a quarter of the price of flax.</i><font size="3"><i><sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"></sup></i></font><i> [...]&nbsp;</i></font><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Avenir-Book"><i>The rise of the textile industries brought with it an expansion of supporting industries, notably of the <b>whaling</b>, maritime and shipbuilding industries.</i></font></span></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="">Another connection is that both dances were devised by Roy Clowes.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Region Classes</i></b></div><div><b>Now is the time to enrol for the Region classes</b>. It might feel as if May is weeks away, but in fact it is just around the corner. The Region have let us know that, thus far, enrolments are low, and that we should encourage members to register for the appropriate class. Details are on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wellingtonscd.org.nz/classes/region-classes/" target="_blank">Region website.</a></div><div><br></div><div>Theses classes are highly recommended, as you get to learn alongside others who are at the same level. And you will meet people from other clubs, whom you are bound to meet again at the various social functions (e.g. Annual Dances) around the region. The classes are on Tuesdays (Basics and Intermediate alternating), from 7:30 to 9:30 pm, at the St Davids Multicultural Church Hall, in Elizabeth St, Petone. &nbsp;Register&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXZKpjpaMw0AU1PuKeQc7gWGQBIBSYr-G0RMVxemPNuQkVEQ/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Basics classes start on Tuesday 7 May</b>, which is less than two weeks away. Please <b>register by 30 April</b> (i.e. <b>this Tuesday</b> - a week before classes start). There will be five classes in all, at fortnightly intervals (7, 21 May, 4, 18 June, 2 July). The teacher is Diane Bradshaw, one of the Lower Hutt Club teachers. People in their 1st or 2nd year of dancing, will benefit hugely from attending these classes. You will revisit the basic steps, and many of the formations you have learned so far, but be able to refine them. Details of what will be covered are in this document.</div><div></div></div></div></div><li><a href="2024 InviteFamily 18May.pdf" target="_blank"><big>2024 InviteFamily 18May</big></a><br><li><a href="Flyer-Basics-2024-Final.pdf" target="_blank"><big>Flyer-Basics-2024-Final</big></a><br><li><a href="Flyer-Intermediate-2024-Final.pdf" target="_blank"><big>Flyer-Intermediate-2024-Final</big></a><br><li><a href="Historical RSCDS Dances 2024 Poster.pdf" target="_blank"><big>Historical RSCDS Dances 2024 Poster</big></a><br><li><a href="WS flyer 2024 5March.pdf" target="_blank"><big>WS flyer 2024 5March</big></a><br><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/iframe-resizer/4.1.1/iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js"></script></body></html>
