I was glad there is a nice grunty heater in the hall. We had reasonable numbers, 23, with Catherine having to dance to make up the third set. Welcome back to Denis and Alison, who have been very busy with activities around Anzac Day for the past few weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Royal Patronage of the RSCDS</i></b></div><div>The RSCDS has announced that His Majesty the King has accepted the Patronage of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society (RSCDS). You can read the official announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchi.mp/rscds/dst-royal-patronage?e=967a522f1b" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Tonight's dances</i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Dame Margaret's Jig</b> (J) - This was the "notice board" walking warm-up dance. There are no cribs or videos available online, but the quick description is: R&amp;L; Cross, cast, 1/2 fig 8 up; adv &amp; ret with corners; circle 6H. The dance was devised by Romaine Butterfield for Dame Margaret Sparrow, who received her honour for services to medicine and the community (particularly in the field of family planning) in 2002. She was also<a href="https://nzawards.org.nz/winners/dame-margaret-sparrow/" target="_blank"> Senior New Zealander of the Year</a>&nbsp;in 2020. Dame Margaret was a keen dancer for many decades in Kelburn and Ngaio clubs.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Toast to the Mousies</b> (R) - This fun dance is on the programmes of both Ngaio's and our own Annual Dances. We have danced it several times at club, but a few of people had not danced it before, so Catherine took us through it slowly. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17459/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17459/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Swan and the Tay</b> (S) - The name refers to two rivers of the cities of Perth - the Swan in Perth, Australia, and the Tay in Perth, Scotland. The dance includes a formation that was new to some: "<a href="https://youtu.be/-lnJ_Oq_N_Q" target="_blank"><i>Corners pass and turn</i></a>".&nbsp; The dancing couple dances around the space occupied by their corners, while the corners come into the middle turn and go back to place. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14741/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14741/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Chased Lovers</b> (J) - The title is a word-play on "chased" and "chaste", as the first couple don't ever touch each other. The dance includes <i>tandem diagonal reels</i>, &nbsp;and also "<i>corners pass and turn</i>". <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/16465/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/16465/</a>&nbsp;This is on Tawa's Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Culla Bay</b> (S) - We did this square set strathspey last week. It is on our Annual Dance programme, so I am sure we will be doing it again a few times more before the big night. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1473/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1473/</a>. &nbsp;</li><li><b>Miss Johnstone of Ardrossan</b> (R) - Devised by Roy Goldring for Muriel Johnstone, amazing SCD pianist, who hailed from Ardrossan on the North Ayrshire coast. The dance consists of two halves which are sort-of repeated, but inside out, or palindrome (or something ...). It is a 5C dance and each couple only does it once. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9638/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9638/</a>&nbsp;This is on Ngaio's Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Reel of the Royal Scots</b> (R) - This was our "brief only" dance. It is very popular and one of the "must know" dances. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5529/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5529/</a>&nbsp;Also on Ngaio's programme.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;<b>The Rev John MacFarlane</b> (J) - This was an extra dance, was we had time to do one more ... However, it is aa 4C dance, and we only had two 3C sets left, so it was a bit messy. Devised by NZer Gary Morris to commemorate the founding in Wellington of NZ's first Scots Church. The Rev John MacFarlane performed the first service on Petone Beach. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5555/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5555/</a>&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tawa Club Committee Meeting</i></b></div><div>The Club's committee will meet on Tuesday 21 May.
