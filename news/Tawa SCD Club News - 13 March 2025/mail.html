Originally intended for the 'new' dancers, who started dancing with us in August last year, but disappointingly, they have not (yet) returned. Still, we can all do with some revision.&nbsp;</div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>The Old Man of Storr (R)</b> - This was tonight's walking warm-up dance. It's a nice easy dance, and is the first dance on the programme for our Annual Dance in May. <a href="https://www.scottish-country-dancing-dictionary.com/dance-crib/old-man-of-storr.html" target="_blank">https://www.scottish-country-dancing-dictionary.com/dance-crib/old-man-of-storr.html</a> The title refers to a rocky hill on the Isle of Skye.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Mad Hatter</b> (J) - Devised by Wellington teacher Iain Boyd.

Then we practised the "<i>Knot</i>", emphasising that it starts with half a RH turn, and only after that, the R hands go over into Allemande hold. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4484/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4484/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Joie de Vivre</b> (J) - &nbsp;This is the second dance on our Annual Dance programme &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7283/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7283/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Violynne</b> (R) - Devised by J'ville's teacher Rod Downey for Lynne Scott, who plays the violin.

Khandallah Town Hall, Ganges Road, Khandallah. There will be live music from Jason Morris, Hilary Ferral and Anna Miller. I attached the programme last week. A Tartan night is like a club night, but with live music and with guests from other clubs. Attendees are encouraged to wear some tartan (but it's not compulsory). It should be a great evening's dancing. It is designed to give new dancers the opportunity to dance to live music. Dancers in their first year are welcome to join and try a night at a different club.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Saturday 3 May,&nbsp;</b><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">7:00 pm -</span><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">&nbsp;</span><b style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Manawatu Scottish Society SCD Club 70th Anniversary Dance</b><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">, Whakarongo Hall, car Stoney Creek Rd and Napier Hwy, Palmerston North.

He was a significant figure in the SCD world, especially in Wellington where he danced and taught for many years. He devised a number of dances. He was one of the first NZ examiners of aspiring SCD teachers. His funeral was held yesterday, Wednesday 12 March. A full obituary and reminiscences are likely to be published in the next issues of Kiwi News and Harbour City Happenings.&nbsp;</font></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Finally ...</i></b></div></div><div>Another reminder about <b>membership fees </b>being due by the end of March.
