Didnt it feel bleak to arrive at club in the dark? However, once we started dancing tonight, it was actually very warm, and we had to open up an outside door to let the breeze in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We had good numbers tonight, just over three sets. Catherine introduced a new way to start off &nbsp;a club night: &nbsp;</div><div>She wrote the instructions for the first warm-up (i.e. walking) dance up on the notice board, and invited dancers to read them, as she was not going to teach or brief the dance. It is just another way we can learn a dance: &nbsp;Read the instructions, visualise the formations, dance the dance in your mind, try and remember the sequence of the formations, and then dance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In the coming weeks Catherine will be using this start to the night. She hopes it will encourage people to arrive a good few minutes <b>before 7:30</b>, so they can read, digest and learn the dance before we start dancing (at 7:30!).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i><br></i></b></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Tonights dances</i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Lady Catherine Bruces Reel</b> (J) This was the warm-up dance that Catherine wrote up on the board. As you can see<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3594/#cribs"> here,</a>&nbsp;the instructions are really very simple. Note that, though it has Reel in the title, it is actually a Jig. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3594/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3594/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Glen Etive</b> (R) Devised by Wellington teacher Iain Boyd. It includes a reel of 3 on opposite sides, &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8051/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8051/</a>&nbsp;In the instructions in this link, it says all turn RH on bars 21-24. &nbsp;But the way we danced it, at least in the set I was in, we just had the 1st couple turning RH, before blending into the circle. Perhaps Catherine had better (i.e. the original) instructions than what was on the link (It did say the cribs were taken from the video). Iain Boyd is often reluctant to allow the instructions for his dances to be published on the internet. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li><b>Corner Meeting</b> (J) Before dancing this, we had a bit of step practise: Setting twice (i.e. 4 bars of pas de Basque) followed by four bars of skip change, with the emphasis on the <b>hop</b> at the start of the skip change. This dance was devised by Rod Downey (Johnsonvilles teacher) to teach the concept of corners the 1s set twice to their corners, then turn them for 4 bars (in skip change)&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13790/#cribs">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13790/#cribs</a>&nbsp;There is no video.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Balquidder Strathspey</b> (S) &nbsp;Starts with reels of 3 on opp sides (i.e. 1s cross through 2nd place on opp sides), then back on own sides. This is a strathspey, there fore the reels are <b>slow</b>. Take care to dance the reels slowly - in time with the music. It takes <b>8 bars</b> for the reel, and it is so easy to go faster, and get to the end by bar 6. The trick is to make the loops of the reel nice and wide. Again this dance involves corners - CPCP in the cribs means - turn 1st <b>c</b>orner RH, turn<b> p</b>artner LH, turn 2nd <b>c</b>orner RH, cross LH with <b>p</b>artner back to own side. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/377/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/377/</a></li><li><b>The Wild Geese</b> (J) Another dance in which we transition from setting (pas de Basque) to skip change (remember the hop at the start of skip change).&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7147/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7147/</a>&nbsp;The Wild Geese refer to Irish soldiers who fought in the service of foreign kings in the 17th C.</li><li>&nbsp;<b>Napiers Index</b> (J) We did this dance last week. Again corners are involved, this time in balance in line.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10535/</a></li><li><b>The Saint John River</b> (S) The name refers to a river in eastern Canada.&nbsp;<font face="Avenir-Book"><span style="font-size: medium;">At Saint John, the powerful&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/article/bay-of-fundy-and-gulf-of-maine/">Bay of Fundy</a><font size="3">&nbsp;tides throw the river back through a narrow gorge called Reversing Falls.
