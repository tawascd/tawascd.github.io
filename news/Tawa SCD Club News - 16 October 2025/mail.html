We had not quite three sets tonight, bit of an awkward number, but it allowed some people to sit out, and have a rest ...&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The night's focus was on setting (pas de Basque), formations involving corners, and a bit of practice of Strathspey setting and travelling steps.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Corners:</b> When the dancing couple is in second place, their first corner is diagonally across on the opposite side, and their second corner is diagonally across on their left side. Imagine holding your arms spread out, your right hand points at your 1st corner, and your left hand points at your 2nd corner. Your corners will (almost) always be the opposite gender.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Strathspey:</b>&nbsp;For the <b>setting</b> step (sideways) the non-weight bearing foot is raised behind the other calf, <b>touching</b> the calf - not "hanging off the back". Remember: Catherine likes things <b>tidy</b>.&nbsp;</div><div>For the <b>travelling</b> step, the non-weight bearing leg must not be lifted up (neither forward, nor hanging off the back). Slide it forward past the other leg during the hop, it almost touches the floor as it slides past. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div>Numbers 1-4 were for everyone. No 5 &amp; 6 were for the more experienced.

As the tutor of prospective tutors, she will be leading a workshop for Teaching Certificate candidates, who will be sitting their Unit 2 exam.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Sad news</i></b></div><div>I received the sad news that long-time SC dancer Helen Simmers passed away last week. Helen was the partner of Tawa Life Member John Gregory. She had not danced for some years, and had been in very poor health for over a year. The funeral was held on Tuesday afternoon. I sent an email to those of our members who know John and may have known Helen, to advise them of her passing and of funeral details.&nbsp;</div><div>Helen and John G used to dance in Kelburn Club, and more or less held the club together in its final years, as President, Secretary and everything else, until members' ages rose and membership dropped to a point where they had to close the club. Helen was a delightful, friendly and warm-hearted lady, and she will be missed by many. Needless to say, there were many SC dancers at the funeral. "About three sets", said John, as he thanked people for attending.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tuesday afternoon dancing</i></b></div><div>Last Tuesday's session with Iain Boyd had fewer attendees than usual, as some attended Helen's funeral. To honour Helen and John, he taught a dance he had devised for them some years ago, "<i>Wild Flowers in Bloom</i>", inspired by Helen's love of flowers. A nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div>21 October - General group with Catherine</div><div>28 October - Experienced group with Iain Boyd</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Fugues Day</i></b></div><div>Several Tawa members (Hilary, Debbie S, Diane B, Joy and Desiree) attended this class last Saturday. Rod Downey taught some interesting and complex dances, and a great afternoon tea was provided by Elaine and Kevin Lethbridge. John was asked to video three dances, but only the strathspeys were worth keeping. The quick-time dances looked too confused, only one was partly suitable.
