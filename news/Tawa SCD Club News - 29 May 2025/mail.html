We danced it in 3C sets.

We started by learning the middle 16 bars when the 1s have got into 3rd position (2x <i>Teapots</i>; then<i> 1s turn RH</i> with the person diagonally right from them at the end of the set, then <i>turn LH</i> with the person diagonally left from them at the other end of the set). The whole dance is quite symmetrical, as the first 8 bars are a circle to the left, then a long cast. And the last 8 bars are a long cast &nbsp;and a circle to the right.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9636/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9636/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchmickery" target="_blank">Inchmickery</a>&nbsp;refers to a small island in the Firth of Forth, about 3km north of Edinburgh.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Indian River Strathspey</b> (S) - This is a 3C dance, where couples are in a triangle. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7560/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/7560/</a>&nbsp; The Indian River is in Florida, USA (check out the Extra Info). Catherine chose this dance as it is on a programme of a dance she will be attending while in Scotland.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Merlin's Thorn</b> (J) - &nbsp;Catherine told us that the deviser, Alex Gray, made an impromptu visit to the Lower Hutt Club, and taught this dance to the club. He also devised the formation with which the dances finishes - <i>The Helix,</i> which is a progression. Catherine taught this formation first. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10593/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10593/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Shiftin' Bobbins</b> (R) - Ngaio - A great favourite. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6048/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/6048/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Broadway</b> (S) - A lovely strathspey. Bars 9-17, and bars 18-24 have <i>Set &amp; Link for 3C</i>, followed by <i>Half Diag R&amp;L </i>to the right. Hint: the person who is on the left of the <i>Set &amp; Link (</i>who links through the middle), is not involved in the <i>Half Diag R&amp;L</i>. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13771/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13771/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Hazel Tree</b> (J) - This dance by John Drewry starts with an <i>Espagnole, </i>which we practised first, as it is more often danced in Strathspey time, but this was in Jig time.
