(Dreich is Scottish word for dreary, bleak, and wet weather). That may account for the fact we had just two 5C sets &nbsp;last night, but were very pleased to see Louis and Annette back. &nbsp;And Laura said that her friend Ken, who came along a couple of weeks ago, did enjoy his first foray into SCD and will come again next week. The two 'survivors' of our beginner classes, Ashley and Diane, are doing very well. Diane's husband Paul has a leg injury, but we're hopeful he will eventually make it back to dancing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In her choice of tonight's dances, Catherine emphasised <i>setting</i> (or <i>pas de Basque</i>), and a formations involving corners, including one called "<i>turn corner, partner, corner, partner</i>".</div><div>We had another practise of pas de Basque. Remember how it goes: <a href="https://youtu.be/H0_lkdhMikI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/H0_lkdhMikI</a>&nbsp;</div><div><ul style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><li>Starting on the right foot: &nbsp;R, L, R, pause; L, R, L, pause.&nbsp;</li><li>Place R foot down; place L foot&nbsp;<b>in front</b>&nbsp;of the R foot (in 3rd position, T shape) and raise the R foot off the floor; shift your weight back onto the R foot again, and raise the L foot (pause); repeat, starting with the L foot.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><font face="Avenir-Book">For those who have mastered the rhythm, extend the non-weight-bearing leg out on the diagonal, with toes pointing down, during the pause. This is called the <i>"jete</i>".&nbsp;</font></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Galloway House</b> (R) - This was our walking warm-up dance.

The "Balance in line" in the dance is supposed to represent the saltire of the Scottish Flag. It is often performed at dances by a set of all men (as they would have danced it as POWs).&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Zoologist</b> (J) - We did this dance a couple of weeks ago.

A wonderful turn-out, with 13 or 14 sets on the floor. Nineteen Tawa members were there, including our new dancers, Murray, Ashley and Diane, plus Mary and Duncan who were up on stage with their Saltire Band. Six of our Tawa members are also members of Linden Club (which was hosting the NDC this year), so they were hard at work lending a hand at the entry desk and supper arrangements, and no doubt setting up before, and packing up after the dance. Great work!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here is a photo taken by Andrew Oliver (which I have "pinched" from the Linden newsletter - with Patricia's permission!). It shows how full the dance floor was!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src="IMG_6122.jpeg" alt="IMG_6122.jpeg"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>That's all for now, folks!
