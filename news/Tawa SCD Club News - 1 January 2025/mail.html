I hope 2025 will bring you everything you hope and wish for, including lots of dancing!<div><br></div><div>Just keeping you up to date - Summer School has reached the half-way point, with a day free of dancing, for people to nurse their sore feet and maybe catching up on some sleep!.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not attending the school, but have been enjoying the evening events. I know Joy, Colin and Helen M are attending the full school as residents. And Robert and Brenda, and I think Fiona L, are attending the second half of the school was commuters. Maureen has been attending the teachers' exam class as a commuter and I have not seen her at the evening dances - as the candidates are working very hard and are given "homework", so no time to actually dance!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I was pleased to see Maureen Robson at the "Youth Night". She actually danced three strathspeys, and was feeling very happy. But I was disappointed to see very few Tawa members at the four events I have attended so far. Perhaps you are all saving it up for tomorrow night -<b> The President's Ball.&nbsp;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><i style="font-size: 19px;"><b>The President's Ball - 2 January 2025 &nbsp;(</b></i><a href="https://nzsummerschool2024.nz/evening-functions/#PresidentsBall" target="_blank">https://nzsummerschool2024.nz/evening-functions/#PresidentsBall</a><span style="font-size: 19px;">)</span></div><div>In the Scots College Gym (there will be a 'balloon trail' to show the way from the carpark to the gym)</div><div><b>Starts:</b> at 7:00pm, with Drinks and nibbles</div><div><b>MC: </b>Catherine McCutcheon</div><div><b>Music:</b> Elke Baker, Lisa Scott and Richard Hardie (They were terrific on opening night!)&nbsp;</div><div>Then a "Grand March", followed by dancing until 11pm.</div><div><b>Cost: </b>RSCDS $30; Non RSCDS $35; Spectators $20&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is the night that Tawa is helping out. Catherine will be the MC, and Robert, Brenda, Helen M and Fiona L will be helping to serve the drinks and nibbles before the dance, and the supper at half-time. I will be on door duty. I am hoping for a great turn-out of Tawa members. A great opportunity to experience a "grand march" to start proceedings, with piper Nicole Trewavas leading the march.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I hope that many of you who are in Wellington right now will be able to come along and enjoy a very special event. To encourage you, I am attaching a cribsheet, with links to videos.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>See you there!</div><div><br></div><div><div>Desiree</div><div><div><div dir="auto" style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div dir="auto" style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; line-break: after-white-space;"><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Desiree Patterson</div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">tawa@dancesescottish.org.nz</div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Secretary, Tawa SCD Club</div><div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><li><a href="President's Ball.pdf" target="_blank"><big>President's Ball</big></a><br></body></html>
