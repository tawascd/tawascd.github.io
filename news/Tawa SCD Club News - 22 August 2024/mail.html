We had just 19 people there, including three of our beginners. Hopefully the others will come back (apparently a couple of them have been down with the flu). And we had a visit from Elizabeth and Malcolm Ferguson. Elizabeth is actually a Tawa member, but she doesn't attend very often. She is one of the Lower Hutt Club's teachers, and is also currently the club's secretary. It was lovely to see Malcolm up and about again after a spell of ill-health.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>What we did in the beginners' session</i></b></div><div>We started with a walking warm-up dance, followed by the usual stretches and foot exercises. The walking dance - "<i>Happy to Meet</i>" - included:</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><i>Advance and Retire</i> - <a href="https://youtu.be/4fhjyKdydbA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/4fhjyKdydbA</a>&nbsp;</li><li><i>Back-to-back,&nbsp;</i>a <b>new formation</b> for the beginners. <a href="https://youtu.be/dnpQlzgnqXg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dnpQlzgnqXg</a>&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Before the next dance, <i>"Pluto's Head"</i>, we practised last week's new formation <i>Rights and Lefts.&nbsp;</i><a href="https://youtu.be/k664KkN1oZg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/k664KkN1oZg</a> Remember:</div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>It's a square formation - make it crisp, get to the corners.&nbsp;</li><li>In each 2-couple group, two people will go around the square in clockwise direction (1st man and 2nd lady), the other two go counter-clockwise (1st lady and 2nd man)</li><li><b>New detail:</b> the people going clockwise (1st man and 2nd lady) will do a"<b>courtesy turn</b>" for the last hand on the side. For this, keep looking at the person whose hand you are holding, which will cause you to make the <i>courtesy turn</i> as you get back to place.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep hands at above waist level. Do not let them droop.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>For the next dance, "<i>12 Coates Crescent"</i>, Catherine had us practise the <b>transition between strathspey setting step</b> (sideways) <b>and travelling step</b> (forward). This dance starts with "Cross, set, cross set".&nbsp;</div><div>When setting to the right, the left foot is placed behind the right calf. Then from setting to the left, transitioning into a travelling step, the right foot does not go behind the left calf, instead it moves smoothly past the left leg to start the next step forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There was a <b>new formation</b> in the next dance: A " <i><b>Figure of 8 along the side</b></i>"</div><div>The 1st couple dances in a figure of 8 shape around the 2s and the 3s. In this dance both partners dance <b>in </b>to the set to begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Run7sMLtN2I" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Run7sMLtN2I</a>&nbsp;(note: in the video only the man goes in, the lady goes out)&nbsp;</div><div>In a 4-couple set, do not overshoot. Only go around the 2nd and 3rd person, don't include the 4th!</div><div>We practised in in a 3C set, and after the 1s had done the Fig of 8, the 3s did the Fig of 8 starting from the bottom of the set. &nbsp;This is how the next dance, "<i>The Waratah Weaver"</i> starts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>New formation: "Reels of 3"</b>&nbsp;</div><div>At this stage, class was going so well, with the beginners doing everything right, that Catherine decided to teach the <b>"Reels of 3"</b>, which she had planned to to next week.&nbsp;</div><div>In this formation, all three dancers dance a <i>figure of 8</i>, though they all start from a different position. The 1s and 3s dance it like in the previous dance, both going<b> in</b> to the set to begin. The 2s, in the middle start the fig of 8 by going <b>out</b> of the set. Think of 3 slot cars going on the same fig of 8 track.&nbsp;</div><div>On this video,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/1LanKzTOCLg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/1LanKzTOCLg</a> only watch the first part, in Strathspey tempo, with only a single reel. Ignore the other reels for now.&nbsp;</div><div>I am sure Catherine will go into more detail next week.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The last dance for the beginners was "<i>Across Kinness Burn</i>", which starts with the 1s dancing a <b>fig 8 along the side</b>, followed by <b>reels of 3 on the side</b>. I couldn't find a video for this dance.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Last night's dances</i></b></div><div>The first five dances were done as learning dances with the beginners. The last three dances are all on the programme of the Johnsonville/Capital City Annual Dance programme.&nbsp;</div><div style=""><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Happy to &nbsp;Meet</b> (J) - This was the warm-up walking dance.Devised by Wellington teacher, Iain Boyd. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/2782/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/2782/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Pluto's Head</b> (R) - <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9486/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9486/</a></li><li><b>12 Coates Crescent</b> (S) - The name of this dance is the address in Edinburgh of the RSCDS headquarters. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9106/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9106/</a></li><li><b>The Waratah Weaver</b> (J) - This dance introduced Figures of 8 along the sides. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8203/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8203/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Across Kinness Burn</b> (S) - This started with Figs of 8 on the side, which then flowed into reels of 3 on the side.&nbsp;</li><li><b>The&nbsp;Lady in Pink</b> (J) - A 5 C dance in a 5C set.
