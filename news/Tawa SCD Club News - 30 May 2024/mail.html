Several people sent apologies, and I suspect several more will be away for the long weekend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tonights dances</i></b></div><div>Catherine is continuing to prepare us for our Annual Dance. We have done most of the dances on the programme at least once.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Come What May</b> (J) This was the noticeboard walking warm-up dance. A very simple 2C dance, devised by Wellington teacher Romaine Butterfield. It was devised on 1 May 2010, hence the title. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17900/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17900/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Baldyquash</b> (R) Devised by John Drewry. Apparently he saw a road sign with the name Baldyquash, and thought it sounded like a good name for a dance. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10786/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10786/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Jean Martin of Aberdeen</b> (S) Tawa Devised by Muriel Johnstone, SCD pianist extraordinaire, and SCD teacher. The 3C strathspey finishes with a&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/MQB2KxKgwIg" target="_blank"><i>2C Bourrel</i></a>. Catherine spent some time making sure we knew how to dance the Bourrel. Take care not to overcook the 3/4 turn (or you might not meet your partner after the twirl). <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/12542/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/12542/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Montgomeries Rant</b> (R) Tawa This is an old dance, dating back to 1749. It very popular, one of the must know" dances. Rant is a Scots word for a romp, or a boisterous frolic - nothing to do with losing ones temper ... The extra info on the link tell you who the Montgomeries were. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4641/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4641/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>A Capital Jig</b> (J) Tawa This dance starts with<a href="https://youtu.be/jBwPkrSkcPg" target="_blank">Set and rotate for 2 couples</a> (watch the 2nd demo on the link), which we practised a couple of times first. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13581/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13581/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Monymusk</b> (S) Tawa We did this dance last week. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4646/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4646/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Beach Dancer</b> (J) This was this weeks brief only dance. This was devised by the late Eddy West, of Whangarei. A very popular dance in the Wellington Region. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/11587/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/11587/</a></li><li><b>The Lochalsh Reel</b> (R) Through this dance has been around for some years, it was published recently in Book 53. It has some interesting moves, with flow very well, and finishes with teapots (which Catherine did not like!). &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10306/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10306/</a>&nbsp;We were her guinea pigs, she said, as she will be teaching this at the Kings Birthday weekend school in Raglan.&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Upcoming events</i></b></div><div><br></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><b style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Next Thursday, 6 June </b><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">As it will be the first Thursday of the month, Tawa Club will have a</span><b style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"> Tartan&nbsp;</b><font face="Avenir-Book"><b>Night. </b>We will have supper &nbsp; coffee/tea and biscuits.<b>&nbsp;</b>Wear some Tartan if you can.&nbsp;</font></li><li style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b>Monday 17 June</b>, 7:30 pm &nbsp;<b>Johnsonville Club Tartan Night</b>, Khandallah Town Hall, Ganges Road, Khandallah.
