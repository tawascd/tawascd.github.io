It was lovely to see everyone back after the summer break. We had 31 people tonight - four sets, with Catherine dancing too. Brilliant! Good to see some people back whom we hadn't seen for some time in 2024.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We had a great night's dancing, and finished up with supper - it being the first Thursday of the month, and our first night of the year. Thank you to Jo L and Caroline for organising supper tonight. This year we will be having supper - and sometimes Tartan nights - on the first Thursday of the month. To share the task of doing supper, we would love some of our members to offer to take a turn.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i><br></i></b></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Tonight's dances</i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Crabbit Shona (J) - &nbsp;</b>This was the warm-up dance, which we walked, to get our muscles and brains back into dancing mode.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13259/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13259/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Auld Grey Cat (R) -&nbsp;</b><a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/295/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/295/</a>&nbsp;.

Attendees are encouraged to wear some tartan (but it's not compulsory). It should be a great evening's dancing. It is designed to give new dancers the opportunity to dance to live music. Dancers in their first year are welcome to join and try a night at a different club.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></span></div><div><b style="font-size: 16px;">Saturday 3 May, </b>7:00 pm - <b style="font-size: 16px;">Manawatu Scottish Society SCD Club 70th Anniversary Dance</b>, Whakarongo Hall, car Stoney Creek Rd and Napier Hwy, Palmerston North.

It's the church 'on the hill', a few minutes' walk from the Johnsonville train station and bus hub. There's usually plenty of parking.</i></p></div><div><p style="line-height: 16px; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: none;"><i>Daytime dancing for more advanced/experienced dancers takes place on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. This group started on February 25 and our first tutor this year is Gaye Collin.&nbsp;</i></p></div><div><p style="line-height: 16px; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: none;"><i>The group is for those keen to learn more complicated dances and formations, as well as improving technique and style, such as phrasing.&nbsp;</i></p></div><div><p style="line-height: 16px; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: none;"><i><b>The Tuesday 'general' sessions will resume on March 18.</b>&nbsp;</i></p></div><div><p style="line-height: 16px; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: none;"><i>Catherine McCutcheon will again take the group. Her focus is on popular dances, including some from clubs' dance programmes as they come up.

Quite a few people attend both 'experienced' and 'general' sessions.</i></p></div><div><p style="line-height: 16px; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: none;"><i><b>The door charge is $5</b>.
