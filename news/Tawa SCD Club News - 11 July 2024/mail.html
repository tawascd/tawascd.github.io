For bars 24-32, the instructions say "s<i>lip step down and back</i>" but we just walked it. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8162/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8162/</a>&nbsp;This is a ceilidh dance - which can get very rowdy in a ceilidh setting! &nbsp;</li><li><b>Kamo Karousel</b> (R) - &nbsp;Devised by the late Eddy West, of Whangarei - Kamo is a suburb of Whangarei. Eddy West also devised &nbsp;"<i>Beach Dancer</i>". Before dancing this, we practised "<i>set and rotate for 3 couples</i>". &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/12669/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/12669/</a></li><li><b>Asilomar Romantic</b> (S) - A lovely strathspey which includes a <i>diamond poussette</i>, and <i>hello-goodbye setting</i>.

Also unusually, there were two "<i>set and link</i>"one after the other, which threw us a bit.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/11661/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/11661/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately there is no video.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Ladies and Gents</b> (R) - This dance includes both a <i>Ladies' Chain</i>, and a <i>Men's Chain.</i> It required quick thinking, especially as the music was rather fast. But we managed OK! Again, no video available. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10482/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/10482/</a></li><li><b>Delvine Side</b> (S) - An old dance, dating back to 1790. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1615/" target="_blank">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1615/</a>&nbsp;A 3C strathspey, in a 4C set - it goes on <b>forever</b>!&nbsp;Maureen gave us the choice between this and <i>City of Belfast</i>.
