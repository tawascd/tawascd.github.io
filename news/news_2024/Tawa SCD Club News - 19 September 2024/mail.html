Some members are still away travelling, and some are unwell, or injured. Hopefully we’ll soon be back to full strength!</div><div><br></div><div>I usually open up the hall at 7:00 pm, as we need to move the tables, and Catherine likes to arrive early, to set up, and to make sure she gets here in time, in case of traffic hold-ups. It would be nice if a few more people could come in early to help with moving the tables and chairs, so that the task doesn’t always fall to the same people. It is usually Maureen and I, Robert and Brenda, and Catherine and Fiona, who move them. And these days, I can’t do much lifting as my hands are fairly knackered. We do appreciate that most people pitch in to put everything back at the end of the night. So thanks for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i>Last night’s dances</i></b></div><div>The new dancers did numbers 1-4, the rest of us did the remaining three dances.</div><div><b style="font-size: 19px;"><i><br></i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>New Year Jig</b> (J) – This was our walking warm-up dance. We danced it last week.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17898/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17898/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Try as we Might</b> (R) – This dance was devised by Lower Hutt teacher Gaye Collin, as a teaching dance to introduce reels across the set. As “try as she might” she could not find an easy dance that included reels across, so she devised one.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Reel Easy</b> (R) – This dance included lots of setting, as Pas de Basque was a new step for the new dancers tonight.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13827/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/13827/</a></li><li><b>First Love</b> (S) – We did this dance last week. It includes a grand chain.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8047/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/8047/</a></li><li><b>The Aviator</b> (J) – &nbsp;This dance was published in Book 52. It depicts a glider being accompanied by a buzzard. Do read the ‘Extra info’ on the link. &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14401/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/14401/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine called this “Desiree’s favourite dance”, because I was inclined to avoid it, as I managed to muck it up a few times. But I think I've got it sussed now!</li><li><b>Miss Eleanor</b> (S) – A lovely strathspey that includes a 3C bourrel. Devised by Ann Dix who also devised <i>Culla Bay</i> and <i>Rodney’s Rant</i> (which we did last week).&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/16526/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/16526/</a></li><li><b>The Montgomeries’ Rant</b> (R) – An oldie but a goodie. A really old oldie, dating back to 1749, and very popular ever since.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4641/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4641/</a>&nbsp;There is a lot of ‘extra info’ in the link about who the Montgomeries were.&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>What was new for our new dancers? &nbsp;</i></b></div><div>Unfortunately some of our new dancers seem to be playing swapsies - when one pair is there, the other isn’t, and vice versa. Last night Ruth and Sarah were there, but Tanya and Hatsuhi weren’t. So much of what we did last week was repeated for Ruth, but she got the hang of it all very quickly (Sarah was not able to dance, but I hope she watched and listened, so she’s all ready for next week).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Right Shoulder/Left Shoulder Reels</b>&nbsp;</div><div>The walking dance, "<i>New Year Jig</i>", started with <i>Rsh Figs of 8</i> and <i>RSh reels</i>. The details of the reels are in last week’s newsletter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Reels across the set</b></div><div>As well as along the sides, reels can also be danced across the set. In “<i>Try as we Might</i>”, the dancing couple cast into 2nd place, where they <i>turn RH</i> (right hand), so that they end up with the lady facing towards the 2nd lady (in 1st place), and the man facing towards 3rd man. They start <i>Rsh reels</i> from the middle position in the reel. In this video shows Rsh reels across the set at 1.03 .</div><div><a href="https://youtu.be/1LanKzTOCLg">https://youtu.be/1LanKzTOCLg</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>Pas de Basque&nbsp;</b></div><div>This is the fifth and last step in Scottish country dancing. The others are: Slip step, skip change of step, strathspey travelling step, and strathspey setting step.&nbsp;</div><div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><span>We practised Pas de Basque in Reel tempo, 4/4, i.e. four even beats.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><ul><li>Catherine demonstrated the step, which has three beats and a pause on the fourth beat.&nbsp;</li><li>Then we tried the step, starting on the right foot: &nbsp;R, L, R, pause; L, R, L, pause.&nbsp;</li><li>Place R foot down; place L foot&nbsp;<b>in front</b>&nbsp;of the R foot (in 3rd position, T shape) and raise the R foot off the floor; shift your weight back onto the R foot again, and raise the L foot (pause); repeat, starting with the L foot.&nbsp;</li><li>We started stepping it out slowly, and increasing in tempo, and finally doing it to the music. &nbsp;</li><li>I think it helps if you don’t put your full weight on the foot that goes in front. Just try it as if you had a stone in your shoe, and you want to lift your foot off quickly.&nbsp;</li><li><font face="Avenir-Book">In the video you’ll see that the dancers kick the foot forward on the last beat (this is called the “jeté”), but for now it is enough to just pause on that beat, until you’ve got the hang of the rhythm.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/H0_lkdhMikI">https://youtu.be/H0_lkdhMikI</a>&nbsp;</font></li></ul></div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">Pas de Basque, also called&nbsp;<i>‘<b>setting</b></i>’, is used as a ‘greeting’, so usually when you set to someone, the other person will set back to you. “<i>Setting</i>” once, consists of two bars - once starting on the R foot and once on the L foot.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div>We danced “<i>Reel Easy, </i>which started with 1s and 2s linking hands and <i>“setting</i>" twice (= 4 bars) to their partners, then turning sideways, 1s facing 2s, and “<i>set</i>" twice again (4 bars). From there, they flow into a Rsh reel on the sides - 1s going down, 2s going up (2s were already facing up after the setting), 3s going up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The next dance, “<i>First Love</i>”, a strathspey (slow tempo) included a <i>grand chain</i> and a <i>circle 6 hands round and back</i>.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Grand chain</b></div><div>Alternating right hand and left hand, as in “Rights and Lefts”, but with six people. Remember the sequence of fitting 6 hand changes into 8 bars of music: <b>Right, left, Ri-i-ight, Left, Right, Le-e-eft.</b> Details in last week’s email.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Circle in Strathspey&nbsp;</b></div><div>Remember the we usually circle towards the left first. Strathspey travelling step starts with the right foot. So to start the circle, the right foot has to cross the left to begin. Details in last week’s email.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;">Upcoming events in the Wellington Region</span></i></b></div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b>Thursday 26 September,</b>&nbsp;7:30 pm –&nbsp;<b>Ngaio Club</b>&nbsp;<b>Tartan Night</b>&nbsp;.

Three sets were put through their paces with some quite challenging dances, and a couple of easier ones. Just three of us from Tawa attended (Maureen S, Helen M, and Désirée). Jeanette Watson was the MC for the afternoon: she taught Peter Beaumont’s <i>“Fugue 32”</i> and Xiaowen Yu’s <i>“Ōtepoti Octagon"</i> - both quite challenging. Iain Boyd, Rod Downey, and Romaine Butterfield each taught one of their recently devised dances ("<i>Uyea Sound</i>", "<i>Link Road</i>" and "<i>Father Williams' Reel</i>” respectively) and we completed the afternoon with an easier dance by Rod, “<i>The Bunting Bee</i>”. Oh, and there was an impressive afternoon tea as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
