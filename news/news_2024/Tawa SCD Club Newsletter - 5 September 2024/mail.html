Unfortunately our other two beginners, Tanya and Hatsuhi, were not there tonight, as Tanya was unwell. Hopefully we’ll have everyone on deck next week!</div><div><br></div><div>Welcome back to Caroline, who has returned from her overseas travels, and she was sporting a lovely tartan rosette, which she bought in Edinburgh! Very suitable for tonight’s Tartan Night. We also had Diane Bradshaw join us (she's actually a member, though she is not able to attend very often), and Penny from the Linden Club visited also.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Tonight was a Tartan Night since it was the first Thursday of the month, and we enjoyed coffee/tea and home baked biscuits, made by Jo L, who came in specially to organise supper for us, despite not being able to dance yet because of her sprained ankle. And Caroline came in to help with supper too, even though she is still recovering from her jet lag. Thank you both for your dedication, ladies!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tonight’s dances</i></b></div><div style="">The beginners danced the first four dances, which were followed by supper, since it was a Tartan Night. The more experienced dancers then danced numbers 5 and 6, while the beginners watched or went home.&nbsp;</div><div style="">&nbsp;</div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Come What May</b> (J) – This was our walking warm-up dance. We danced this last week&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17900/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17900/</a>&nbsp;It includes "<i>Adv &amp; Ret</i>” and “<i>Back-to-bac</i>k” on the diagonal. The dance was devised by Romaine Butterfield, a long-time Wellington tutor.</li><li><b>The Auld Grey Cat</b> (R) – This dance includes reflection (or ‘mirror’) reels on the sides, and an Allemande. Devised by Iain Boyd, also a long-standing Wellington tutor.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/295/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/295/</a></li><li><b>Light on the Water</b> (S) – This also includes mirror reels on the sides. Catherine adapted the last 8 bars, to make them easier to manage for the new dancers. We danced: All "<i>Adv &amp; Ret</i>" ( 2 tiny steps forward, 2 steps back) , and then “<i>back-to-back</i>"</li><li><b>Crom Allt </b>(R) – Mirror reels to start. This dance introduced the concept of “corners” for the new dancers.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1426/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1426/</a>&nbsp;Devised by Roy Goldring.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Irish Rover</b> (R) – &nbsp;A very popular dance, but you need to have your wits about you, because if you get”lost", it is hard to recover. The only thing to do then, is to go to place for the next time through.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3129/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3129/</a>&nbsp; Apparently it is an all-time favourite at Lower Hutt’s Annual Dances, so it is on Saturday’s programme. Things to remember: After the 3H across, the <b>dancing couple is holding the hand of their first corner</b>, whom they face for a half reel on the diagonal. The other thing many people forget, is the <b>quick left hand turn</b> with your partner, which makes 1L go up, and 1M go down, into the LSh reel across the dance. The dance finishes with half diagonal R&amp;L.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/O-swWpDlJDA">https://youtu.be/O-swWpDlJDA</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Ian Powrie’s Farewell to Auchterarde</b>r (J) – Another dance which is a favourite with the Lower Hutt Club. It’s a 128-bar jig in a square set. It is also a “palindrome” - i.e. the sequence ‘reads’ the same backwards as it does forwards. A lot of moves to remember. Fairly mind-blowing! <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3057/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3057/</a>&nbsp; We did this twice, and then Catherine cruelly suggested partners swap places, and for some of us it all fell apart …</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>What we learned in the beginners’ session</i></b></div><div style="">With two beginners there tonight, who hadn’t been for couple of weeks, and two of the other beginners not there, Catherine had to do some quick adjustments to her programme. Hats off to Catherine!&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div style="">I am hoping that Ruth and Sarah have read, and understood, the formations I explained in my previous emails on the nights they have missed, as I wont explain them in too much detail again.&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div style="">The walking warm-up dance “<i>Come What May</i>” was fairly straightforward, with "<i>Advance and Retire</i>" (two steps forward, two steps back), and "<i>Back-to-back</i>" (two steps forward slightly to the left of the person you are doing this with; step to the right so as to go behind that person, and two steps back).&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div style="">"<i>The Auld Grey Cat</i>” included mirror reels of three on the side. These were new to tonight’s beginners. So we did some Figs of 8 on the side from each position (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) first, then put them together in a reel. The 1s and 2s face each other (1s dance in and down, 2s dance out and up), and the 3s face up, behind the 2s. The 3s dance in and up. The 3s have to give way to the 1s as they come through the middle of the reel.&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div style="">The next dance was a strathspey, which is the slower tempo. We practised strathspey travelling step (forward) and setting step (sideways)&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/ykCf1wmYETk">https://youtu.be/ykCf1wmYETk</a>&nbsp;The sequence for the steps is: step, close, step, hop. (For more details go to my emails of 9 and 16 August)&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div style="">"<i>Light on the Water</i>” also had reels in it. But this was a Strathspey, and reels in this slower tempo take longer to do than in fast time. To prevent one getting to the middle and end too quickly, make the loops of the reel nice and wide. Listen to the music and adjust the speed of your steps to the music’s rhythm.&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div style="">"<i>Crom Allt</i>” introduced the concept of “<i><b>corners</b></i>". In the dance, the 1s progress to the 2nd positions. When the dancing couple stands in 2nd &nbsp;place, the person diagonally across from them on their<b> right is their 1st corner.</b> The person diagonally across from them on their <b>left is their 2nd corner.</b>&nbsp;In this dance, the 1s <i>Adv &amp; Ret</i> with their 1st corner, then turn them RH (right hand); then they <i>Adv &amp; Ret</i> with their 2nd corner, and turn them LH (left hand).&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Upcoming events</i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li><b>THIS Saturday 7 September</b>, 7:30 pm – <b>Lower Hutt 70th Anniversary Ball</b>, Knox Church Hall, High Street, Lower Hutt.

And quite a few of the men performing the haka were wearing the same tartan as a sash (first frame of&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/qBwK3d6R0a0">this video</a>). Upon searching Google, I found out that a special tartan had been designed to pay homage to the first Māori King, Pootaatau Te Wherowhero (1858-1860). It is registered in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=11366">Scottish Registers of Tartans</a>. The colours of a tartan have meaning: in this case, the blue and gold represent the colours of the Kiingitanga, with the gold stripes representing the seven waka that carried the Māori to NZ from the South Pacific. The red, white and black represent the King’s comment, “There is but one eye of the needle, through which the white, red and black must pass”. (The red and the black are on either side of the white stripe - a bit hard to see.)</div><div>With my “weaver’s eye” (I used to be a weaver), I notice that the gold and blue blocks have a stepped zig-zaggy pattern, reminiscent of tukutuku panels, rather than the straight diagonal of a traditional twill.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div></div></div></body></html>
