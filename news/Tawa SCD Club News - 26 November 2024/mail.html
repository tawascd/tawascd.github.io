I was hoping for some photos from the Ngaio Club, because I forgot to take some myself.</div><div><br></div><div>It was a great night, very well attended, with five sets dancing the night away to <i>The Cranberry Tarts'</i> music. Tawa Club members had been specially invited to join Ngaio for their final night, and 18 of our members attended, including Hilary, up on stage, and Jan Bruce and Maureen Robson. It was lovely to see Jan and Maureen, who had come to enjoy the music and watch the dancing. Maureen has had her successful hip surgery and is now able to move more freely, she no longer seems to be in pain. In fact, I was delighted she agreed to dance <i>City of Belfast</i> with me, even though she had not brought her dancing shoes. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This was the last time that Aileen and Hilary were playing together as "<i>The Cranberry Tarts</i>", as Aileen will be leaving NZ to return to Scotland early next year. Ngaio Club marked the occasion by presenting Aileen with a lovely bouquet, to thank her for the many evenings of musical pleasure she has provided to the club over the years.&nbsp;<br><div>

Attendance was a mite disappointing, with only 13 of us there, including John and myself, as both Robert and Brenda, and Colin called in sick. Compared with 30 people attending last year, this was a much more 'select' gathering, but still very sociable and enjoyable. Thanks to those who attended, and for bringing their lovely dishes.&nbsp;</div><div>We managed to dance just one dance on the deck - <i>The Oriel Strathspey</i>, that Catherine taught a few weeks ago. If you remember, that was one of the dances suggested by the RSCDS for the possible contribution to their "<i>Dance Around the World</i>" Facebook event. John took a video, viewing it from above, which he reduced to the stipulated 30 seconds (!), but I have not been able to post it on the RSCDS Facebook page (technology defeated me!). However, I was able to post a longer video, that I took, on the Tawa FB page. You can check it out here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TawaSCD" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/TawaSCD</a>. &nbsp;We only did one dance, as the southerly was making itself felt, so everyone was keen to scuttle back inside for dessert. This included a surprise - a birthday cake for John, who is turning 80 in a few weeks' time - a bit early, but a number worth celebrating, I thought.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 10.52.13 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 10.52.13 PM.png" width="640"></div><div>"Oriel Strathspey".</div><div><br></div><div>Last night (Monday 25 Nov) was the final night for the Johnsonville Club, and again, Tawa was well represented with 10 of our members there. And though there was an advanced group afternoon dancing session today (with Rod Downey), and there is another one next week (with Iain Boyd), I did not attend, as I have mentally 'switched off' from dancing for now - until Summer School.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Summer School</i></b></div><div>Good luck to all those who will be attending either the full or half the school. I am sure you will have a fabulous time. A reminder for those that are not attending the school, but who will be in Wellington over the period of 28 December to 4 January, that the evening functions are open for all to attend.

The function starts with drinks and nibbles at 7:00 pm, during which the Branch President, Debbie Roxburgh, will try to meet as many of the people there as possible. Then before dancing starts, there will be a Grand March, which is a a sight to behold, and fun to take part in.&nbsp;<b>This will also be "Tawa's night", as Catherine will be the MC</b>. Also some of us will be helping on the door and in the kitchen.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Friday 3 January</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://nzsummerschool2024.nz/evening-functions/#Ceilidh" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: none;">The Ceilidh</a>.
