We also had a couple of visitors: Ann and Andrew Oliver. Ann is the tutor at the Linden Club, but she is also the organiser of this year’s Summer School, which is happening in Wellington. She is visiting all the clubs in the region to promote the Summer School.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Welcome back to Ian, who has returned after six weeks travelling in the UK. I had news from Linda Roxburgh, who visited Tawa with husband Ivan for the last three weeks. The expected grandchild, Jameson David Roxburgh, was born yesterday, a day ahead of the due date.

Keep the hands at above waist level.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>After the stretches and foot and ankle exercises, we danced “<i><b>Lady Catherine Bruce’s Reel</b></i>”.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3594/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/3594/</a>&nbsp;We danced this last week also.&nbsp;</div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></i></b></div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;">Step practise</span></i></b></div><div>We reviewed the <b>Strathspey travelling step</b>: “Step, close, step, hop". Remember to slide the non-weight-bearing foot past the other, while keeping the foot close to the floor, with toes pointing down. Do not jerk the knee up.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/ykCf1wmYETk">https://youtu.be/ykCf1wmYETk</a></div><div><b>Strathspey travelling step, backwards</b>. Usually done with only two steps back. We practised dancing forward for two steps, then back for two steps. In the transition, “tidy away” the non-weight-bearing foot behind the calf of the other leg (as in the setting step). This step is done in the least two bars of an <i>allemande</i>.</div><div><b>Dancing strathspey in a circle</b>: The steps are <i>travelling steps</i>, which usually move you forward. In a circle, however, you have to move <i><b>sideways</b></i>. In a circle, one usually circles to the left first, but one always starts with the right foot. So the right foot has to cross to the left to begin the circle. The trick here is that though your feet are going sideways, your body should still be facing into the circle.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/L_3BgigdQO4">https://youtu.be/L_3BgigdQO4</a>&nbsp;Note in the video: the non-weight-bearing foot is “tidied away” behind the calf of the other leg.</div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></i></b></div><div><b><i><span style="font-size: 19px;">New formation: “Rights and Lefts"</span></i></b></div><div>This formation is done with two couples, and it works like a <b>square.</b></div><div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;">With your Right hand, change places across the set with your partner, change Left hands with the other person along the side, then cross Right hands again with your partner, and change places Left hand along the side with the other person.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><ul><li>You are going around in a square, you do not change direction (so no loops or twiddles in the corners). Catherine said “Imagine you are walking around a square table" – You wouldn’t twirl around each time you get to a corner.&nbsp;</li><li>In a couple, one of you will be going clockwise, the other anti-clockwise.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Across</b>&nbsp;is always&nbsp;<b>right</b>&nbsp;hand; &nbsp;<b>along the side</b>&nbsp;is always&nbsp;<b>left</b>&nbsp;hand</li><li>The hands should stay at above waist level - do not let them droop!&nbsp;</li><li>When you have done the whole formation, you are back in the same position from where you started.&nbsp;</li><li>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/k664KkN1oZg">video</a>&nbsp;you will see that two of the people in each square finish with what is called a "courtesy turn”.
