Welcome back to Helen Challands - we havent seen her for quite a while. Since it was the first Thursday of the month, we had a Tartan night, and quite a few people remembered to don their tartans. It also meant we had supper. Thank you to Jo and Caroline for organising the supper and to the extra people who helped with the washing up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Enhancing learning ...</i></b></div><div>Now that we have had two months of dancing for this year, Catherine is re-introducing the Brief only dance each week. Do try to have a look at the instructions and the video before class, and visualise yourself dancing it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also remember to arrive in time to read the dance that Catherine puts up on the notice board, so that you can figure it out and digest it, before we start dancing (at 7:30 sharp!). Its good to discuss it with other dancers - its all part of the teamwork! If necessary, get together with another five dancers, and try it out! Catherine will quickly brief the dance, but wont be teaching it in detail.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Tonights dances</i></b></div><div><ol class="MailOutline"><li><b>Good Hearted Glasgow</b> (J) This was the Notice Board dance, which we walked as a warm-up. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/2604/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/2604/</a>&nbsp; A nice simple dance, which was devised as a result of a campaign in 1988 to encourage easy forms of exercise - dancing being one of them.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Andersons Rant</b> (R) This is the first dance on our Tawa Annual Dance programme. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/140/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/140/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Saint Martins Strathspey</b> (S) This 4C dance in a 4C set (i.e. each couple dances it only once), devised by Rory Goldring, features<i> reels of 4</i> on the sides.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5842/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/5842/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Mary Erskine</b> (R) Before dancing this, we practised <i>Doube triangles. </i>Catherine emphasised&nbsp;that the arms should be softly straight, and the supporting couples should move forward or back in order to achieve this (depends on how wide the set is, and also on how long peoples arms are!). Watch how they do it on the first video in this link: &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9008/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/9008/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Culla Bay</b> (S) This lovely square set dance is on our Tawa Annual Dance programme. A Catherine said, it takes longer to say the words to teach it than to dance it. It features <i>reels of 4 </i>across the dance (which is why we had <i>reels of 4</i> in dance no, 3 above). In the this link &nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1473/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/1473/</a>, the second video is introduced by the deviser, Ann Dix - worth watching. There is a lot to remember in this dance, and Catherine promises to do this dance every week for the next few weeks before our Annual Dance.&nbsp;</li><li><b>May the 4th be with you</b> (J) Although today was the 2nd of May, this dance was a nod to the Star Wars films expression <i>May the Force be with you</i>. The dance was devised by French dancer and teacher Antoine Rousseau, who taught at a NZ Summer School some years ago. A dance with deceptively simple formations, but with an interesting and clever twist. Our set rather came unstuck. Unfortunately there is no video in this link.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17306/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/17306/</a>&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Montgomeries Rant</b> (R) This was today's Brief Only dance. It is a very popular dance, and it is one of those must know" dances. &nbsp;The trickiest bit of it is the final reel, which is danced by the 1s on their opposite sides, R Sh to their 2nd corner i.e. the lady enters the reel by going out through the bottom of the set, the man enters the reel going out through the top of the set - both dance to their right. It is a 6-bar reel, and finishes with the 1s crossing back to their own sides on bars 7-8. <a href="https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4641/">https://my.strathspey.org/dd/dance/4641/</a>&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="font-size: 19px;"><b><i>Region Classes&nbsp;</i></b></div><div>The message from the Region Secretary (Brenda Vale) this week is: <i>"<span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><b>Enrolments for both basics&nbsp;and intermediate classes are still very low. </b>Tutors go to a lot of trouble to prepare these classes and the region puts in a lot of effort to ensure they are available every year.&nbsp;</span><font face="Avenir-Book">&nbsp;</font></i></div><div><span style="font-family: Avenir-Book;"><br></span></div><div>The<b> Basics classes</b> start <b>next week - Tuesday 7 May.</b> I hope that those of you who would benefit from these classes got around to registering. Registrations were due by last Tuesday 30 April, but walk-ins will be welcome for any (one or more) of the classes. The classes will be 7:30-9:30 pm, at St Davids Multicultural Church Hall, in Elizabeth St, Petone. The teacher will be Diane Bradshaw.
