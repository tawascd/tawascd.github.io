            <p>Scottish Country Dancing is not only great fun; it is also good exercise. With lively music it promotes pleasant social interaction and aerobic activity, both important parts of good mental and physical health.</p>

            <p>We would be very pleased if you choose to join us so that you can have many happy years of dancing ahead. We meet in the Tawa Bowling Club for a 7.30pm start although doors open at 7.00pm. No partner, special clothes or shoes are needed although we recommend shoes with soft soles.</p>

            <p>It is suitable for people of all ages, teenage to retired. If you are new to dancing, look out for notification of Beginners Classes.</p>

        <div id="div2" class="hidden">
            <p>Arriving by 7.20pm is recommended. The night normally starts with a simple walking warm-up dance. The warm-up dance is followed by stretching exercises for various parts of the body. Most dances on a club night are taught so will be walked through beforehand. The night ends with some warm down music. Periodically we have Tartan and Theme nights. There is a yearly Tawa Annual Dance.</p>

            <p>The Wellington Region usually offer classes each year at three different levels. These are mid-year Basics, Intermediate and Advanced classes. A new year is often welcomed with a Hogmanay Dance.</p>
